                uses outlined and described in this section of our policy. Cookies are small files that are
                placed on your browser or device by the website or app you’re using or ad you’re viewing. We use
                these technologies for a variety of reasons, such as allowing us to show you content and
                advertising that’s most relevant to you; improving our products and services; and helping to

                others on and off our Services. When you comment on another person’s post or like their
                content on BHS, that person decides the audience who can see your comment or like. If their
                audience is public, your comment will also be public.</p>

              <p className="pb-5">Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the audience they choose. For
